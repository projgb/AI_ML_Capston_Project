## Capston Project for SCTP AI-ML Associate Developer Course - Image Classification using Deep Neural Network

# Introduction

Artificial Intelligence is achieved by applying Machine learning and Deep learning models to classification, identification, prediction and generation of text, vision, speech.
 Human vision processing is highly evovled. Comparatively, AI based computer vision is in progressing stages. Basic building blocks of computer vision system involves classification (object recognition), object detection, instance segementation, object location and so on.

**Problem statement:** Correct image classification (or object recognition) is vital as it leads to next steps in computer vision.
This could either be achieved by tabulating distinguishing attributes of objects to classify, like length and width attributes of Iris flower species in Iris dataset. Or, by extracting and identifying the edges and features from the binary pixel data of the digital images.

 Former uses the unsupervised (classification) machine learning models, like Logisitcs Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest.

 Latter is performed using deep learning neural networks, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks and/or variants.

**Project Purpose:**
Learn and develop a CNN based image classification system using Tensorflow and Keras frameworks. Additionally, familarize with the existing image classification research and models, and the next steps in the computer vision.
